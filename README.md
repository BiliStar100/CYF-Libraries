  Here is a collection of libraries of CYF that I have made!
  bs.lua is a library that enables you to use blue soul in an easy way and also,with a better control to optimize playing experience!
  how to use it:
  bs=require "bs.lua",then you can use bs.into() to switch to blue mode and bs.back() to switch back to red mode. 

  ConvenientBulletSpawner is a library that helps us create bullet objects in a more convenient way,including parameters like omega and other stuff.
